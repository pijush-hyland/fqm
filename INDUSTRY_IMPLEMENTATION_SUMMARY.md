# Freight Quote Management System - Industry-Standard Implementation

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Industry-Standard Features

### üèóÔ∏è Master Data Management
We have successfully implemented comprehensive master data management with industry-standard terminology:

#### 1. **Location Master Data** (`/api/locations`)
- **Entity**: Location with professional freight location types
- **Location Types**: SEA_PORT, AIRPORT, CITY, INLAND_PORT
- **Industry Codes**: UN/LOCODE port codes, ISO 3166-1 country codes
- **Sample Data**: 30 major global locations including:
  - **Sea Ports**: Port of Shanghai, Port of Rotterdam, Port of Singapore, etc.
  - **Airports**: LAX, JFK, Heathrow, Frankfurt, Dubai International, etc.
  - **Cities**: New York, London, Shanghai, Dubai, Singapore, etc.

#### 2. **Container Type Master Data** (`/api/container-types`)
- **Entity**: ContainerType with precise industry specifications
- **Industry Standards**: 
  - **CBM (Cubic Meter)** calculations for volume capacity
  - **Gross Weight** vs **Tare Weight** vs **Max Payload** computations
  - **Volume Weight** calculations for chargeable weight determination
- **Container Types**: 11 standard container types:
  - **20GP/40GP**: General Purpose containers
  - **20HC/40HC**: High Cube containers  
  - **20RF/40RF/40RH**: Refrigerated containers
  - **20OT/40OT**: Open Top containers
  - **20FR/40FR**: Flat Rack containers

### üîß Industry-Standard APIs

#### **Location Management APIs**
```
GET /api/locations                    # All locations
GET /api/locations?locationType=SEA_PORT  # Filter by type
GET /api/locations?search=singapore   # Search locations
GET /api/locations/seaports           # Get all sea ports
GET /api/locations/airports           # Get all airports
GET /api/locations/countries          # Get country codes
POST /api/locations                   # Create new location
PUT /api/locations/{id}               # Update location
DELETE /api/locations/{id}            # Delete location
```

#### **Container Type Management APIs**
```
GET /api/container-types                        # All container types
GET /api/container-types?activeOnly=true        # Active only
GET /api/container-types/suitable?weightKG=1000&volumeCBM=10  # Find suitable containers
POST /api/container-types/volume-weight         # Calculate volume weight
POST /api/container-types/chargeable-weight     # Calculate chargeable weight
POST /api/container-types                       # Create container type
PUT /api/container-types/{id}                   # Update container type
```

### üìä Enhanced Data Model

#### **Industry-Standard Terminology Implementation**
- **CBM (Cubic Meter)**: Proper volume calculations for containers and cargo
- **Gross Weight**: Total weight including packaging and container
- **Volume Weight**: Calculated weight based on dimensional weight formula
- **Chargeable Weight**: Higher of gross weight or volume weight
- **Max Payload**: Available cargo capacity (Max Gross Weight - Tare Weight)

#### **Updated ShippingRequirementDto**
```java
// Industry-standard fields
private Double grossWeightKG;        // Gross Weight (Chargeable Weight)
private Double volumeCBM;            // CBM (Cubic Meter)
private Double volumeWeightKG;       // Calculated volume weight
private String containerTypeCode;    // References ContainerType.code
```

### üéØ Professional Features Ready for Admin UI

#### **Searchable Select Components**
- Location search with type filtering (Sea Ports, Airports, Cities)
- Container type selection with suitability matching
- Country code dropdown with standardized ISO codes

#### **Admin Master Data Management**
- Full CRUD operations for Locations and Container Types
- Validation with industry standards
- Automatic calculations (CBM, payload, chargeable weight)
- Data integrity with unique constraints

### üîÑ Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. **Searchable Select Components**:
   - Location selector with type-ahead search
   - Container type selector with specifications display
   - Country/port code dropdowns

2. **Admin Pages**:
   - Location management interface
   - Container type management with calculator tools
   - Bulk import/export capabilities

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Industry terminology tooltips and help text
   - Weight/volume calculators integrated into forms
   - Real-time container suitability checking
